# GDPSRestorer
For times where you seriously mess up...

## Before you use!
This repo is a direct upload of the GDPS Restorer I made for VGDPS. I am making a new repo for this as the original has been
lost due to the collapse of VPS. This is an old codebase of mine and should in no way represent what I am currently capable
of. I am currently working on a replacement for this named [gdps-utils](https://github.com/RealistikDash/gdps_utils), which
should outclass this in every way possible. While that is still in progress, you may use this tool as a replacement.

Some things (such as the level ID adjust) are made in a really weird manner, so I apologise in advance.

## Features

GDPS Restorer currently contains multiple cleanup features.
- Restore rating from backup
- Adjust LevelIDs
- Delete level data for levels not in the DB.
- Rapid bot cleanup (only profiles+users)
- In-depth bot cleanup (takes care of levels+account comments etc)
- Restore bans from backup.
- Restore levels from backup

## Why?
Because I messed up... Remember kids always back up your database.
